This script will automatically update, add i386 architecture, and install some of my favorite tools and programs onto kali or ubuntu for a quick start. 

You may be prompted to allow services to automatically restart. Once you get to thefatrat install (last install), I would reccomend that you change the location of saved files to ~/home/USERNAME/Downloads otherwise you must go into the root user files to locate the payloads.

move the .bash_aliases to the home directory and reboot for the aliases to take effect. You also may need to change the adapter name to match what you have in iwconfig. 

Enjoy :)
