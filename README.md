### NOTE that it is always nice to either make a snapshot or a copy of your virtual machines before doing permanent changes. If on bare metal then make a backup or make sure the programs in the file match your version or flavor 

This script will automatically update, add i386 architecture, and install some of my favorite tools and programs onto kali or ubuntu for a quick start (Debian 10 and Ubuntu 22.04). If you want to change the version, update the wget links to the correct version by going to that programs download page Ex: veracrypt, sublime text, etc. Make sure to change all relevant commands with the proper file name if you do so.

You may be prompted to allow services to automatically restart. Once you get to thefatrat install (last install), I would reccomend that you change the location of saved files to ~/home/USERNAME/Downloads otherwise you must go into the root user files to locate the payloads.

move the .bash_aliases to the home directory and reboot for the aliases to take effect. You also may need to change the adapter name to match what you have in iwconfig for any wireless attacks. 


### Terms of use:
I am in no way responsible for any actions of anybody other than my own. Any use of my coding is soley your responsibility. Anyone may use and change these scripts to suit their needs as long as they do not claim credit for creating it themselves. Don't be that script kitty :/ 


Enjoy :)
